          It takes curiosity, an open mind, and freedom to see things in a new way.
          From Grade 1 onwards, students enter the "Knowledge Phase," a time when their natural inclination towards abstraction and intellectual exploration becomes more pronounced. At ABODE, we embrace this phase with a focus on developing independent learning skills while deepening their sense of community. Emphasis is placed on language development and logical reasoning, with interdisciplinary projects that merge subjects, stimulating curiosity, creativity and problem-solving. Through hands-on activities and collaborative work, students cultivate both academic and social skills.

          ABODE follows the Cambridge International Primary Programme, while also integrating key objectives from the CBSE curriculum to ensure students have the option to transition smoothly to the CBSE board.
